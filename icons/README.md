   - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

2. **Design software**:

   - GIMP (free)

3. **AI tools**:

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use simple, recognizable imagery
- Include the LinkedIn theme colors (#0077B5)
- Ensure icons are visible on both light and dark backgrounds
- Keep design consistent across all sizes
- Use PNG format with transparency

## Temporary Solution

For testing, you can use placeholder icons. There are online generators that can create simple placeholder icons based on text or initials (e.g., "LLF" for LinkedIn Lead Finder).

## Recommended Design

Consider an icon that combines:
- A magnifying glass (for "finder")
- LinkedIn "in" logo style
- Document or contact card imagery
